# Here is the questions that we answered

Question 1: Please assign values to 5 different variables each corresponding to a 
different simple data type that exist in the Python language. Please pay attention
for the PEP 8 guidelines in choosing variable names!

Question 2: Please assign variables to the individual components of your favorite gene! (e.g. promoter, 5' UTR, start codon,
exon1, intron, exon2, stop codon, 3' UTR). Print the entire gene by using the string concatenation operator, on the standard
output! Note: Feel free to create a fictional gene sequence by randomly filling in the gene components by the characters
corresponding to individual nucleotide bases.
